# 10 Days of Tensorflow (TFUG India)


## Day 1:
Machine Learning Tools - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib 
- Numpy Documentation: https://numpy.org/devdocs/
- Pandas Documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/
- Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/contents.html

Dataset link: https://data.humdata.org/hxlproxy/api/data-preview.csv?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FCSSEGISandData%2FCOVID-19%2Fmaster%2Fcsse_covid_19_data%2Fcsse_covid_19_time_series%2Ftime_series_19-covid-Confirmed.csv&filename=time_series_2019-ncov-Confirmed.csv

Task: 
- Processed the data: On a particular date, If 70% number of confirmed case is zero, then Delete the column. i.e. whole February will be deleted and few more.
- Plot the graph
    - Country Wise
    - Date Wise
    - Continent Wise

Plot the data like:
1. Country-wise like (select any one date)
   x: country
   y: number of case
2. Date wise (select any country)
  x: Date
  y: number of case
3. Continent wise (select any date)
  x: Set of the country (Asia, Europe, America etc)
  y: number of case
  
  
## Day 2:
Real-world data are not simple integers and float; Hence we need to do some pre-processing and Feature Engineering! 

Topic: Feature Engineering & Pre-processing.

Resources:

Task:

Titanic dataset cleaning+Feature Engineering and visualization only (Apply what you learned in Day1)

## Day 3:
We have already Learned about Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering. Let's take a Step Ahead and Learn How to actually Build ML Models and Train them.

To start with here are some basic types of ML problems and some Resources:
1. ML | Types of Learning by GeeksforGeeks https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-types-learning-supervised-learning/
2. Which Machine Learning model to use?: https://towardsdatascience.com/which-machine-learning-model-to-use-db5fdf37f3dd
3. Classification problem: https://towardsdatascience.com/solving-a-simple-classification-problem-with-python-fruits-lovers-edition-d20ab6b071d2
4. Regression Problem: https://towardsdatascience.com/solving-regression-problems-by-combining-statistical-learning-with-machine-learning-82949f7ac18a
5: Official Documentation: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html

Task:
Do the modeling for these Datasets:
a) Predict Loan_Status (http://iali.in/datasets/loan_status_train.csv)
b) Predict rating (http://iali.in/datasets/cereal.csv)
